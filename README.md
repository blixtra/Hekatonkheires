Remote control a doorbell using a NodeMCU and a Raspberry Pi.

Connect the doorbell with a NodeMCU that sends an http request when someone rings the bell.
The Raspberry Pi then lights an LED to indicate that someone rang.
Open the door by pressing a button on the webpage hosted by the Raspbarry Pi.
